In this quarter, the alignment adjustment, used to align income to average GDP, is larger than normal (Table 3), reflecting the current challenges and uncertainties within the income approaches, in particular on the measurement of the Energy Price Guarantee scheme and the Energy Bill Relief Scheme within the accounts, although the size of this alignment adjustment has halved since the first estimate, reflecting upward revisions across income components. Measuring the data\\nReaching the GDP balance\\nThe different data content and quality of the three approaches - the output approach, the expenditure approach and the income approach - dictate the approach taken in balancing quarterly data. To obtain the best estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) (the published figure), the estimates from all three approaches are balanced to produce an average, except in the latest two quarters where the output data take the lead because of the larger data content.\\n While some of the direct impact of the strikes in these industries can be seen in the profile of the quarterly changes in output, we are not able to isolate the impact of these strikes from other factors across the wider economy.', 'score': 0.9691495, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'GDP growth (annual %) - United Kingdom | Data - World Bank Data', 'url': 'https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=GB&most_recent_value_desc=false', 'content': 'GDP growth (annual %) - United Kingdom | Data Data GDP growth (annual %)United Kingdom Data Catalog Data Programs International Debt Statistics Other Books and Reports For Developers GDP growth (annual %) - United Kingdom ====================================== Similar values Highest values Lowest values GDP (constant 2015 US$)  GDP (current US$)  GDP (constant LCU)  GDP: linked series (current LCU)  GDP, PPP (constant 2021 international $)  GDP (current LCU)  GDP, PPP (current international $)  GDP per capita growth (annual %)  Country Most Recent Value All Countries and Economies Country Most Recent Value This site uses cookies to optimize functionality and give you the best possible experience.
